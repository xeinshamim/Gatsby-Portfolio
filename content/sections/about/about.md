<p style="text-align:justify;"> Hi, I’m Shamim! I’m a cybersecurity enthusiast, software engineering student, and web developer passionate about crafting secure and innovative digital solutions.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"> I've been exploring the tech world since my teens and hold certifications like CEH and Security+ and am currently pursuing a bachelor degree in software engineering to further enhance my skills. When I'm not working on code or exploring vulnerabilities, I enjoy writing as a creative outlet and uncovering fascinating patterns in random data.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"> Fun fact: I have a unique fascination with aviation-style number patterns—it keeps my curiosity alive and sparks new ideas! </p>
